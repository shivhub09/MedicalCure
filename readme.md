 ## Natural Language Processing with Python

This code demonstrates how to use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and TensorFlow to perform natural language processing tasks in Python. The code includes functions for stemming words, loading and preprocessing text data, training a neural network for text classification, and evaluating the performance of the model.

### Step 1: Import the Necessary Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries. The code uses the following libraries:

* `nltk`: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python library for natural language processing.
* `LancasterStemmer`: The Lancaster Stemmer is a stemming algorithm that reduces words to their root form.
* `numpy`: NumPy is a Python library for scientific computing.
* `tensorflow`: TensorFlow is a Python library for machine learning.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.stem.lancaster import LancasterStemmer
stemmer = LancasterStemmer()
import numpy as np
import tensorflow
import tensorflow as tf
import random
import json
import pickle
```

### Step 2: Stemming Words

Stemming is a process of reducing words to their root form. This can be useful for natural language processing tasks such as text classification and clustering. The code uses the Lancaster Stemmer to stem words.

```python
def stem_words(words):
  """Stems a list of words.

  Args:
    words: A list of words.

  Returns:
    A list of stemmed words.
  """

  stemmed_words = []
  for word in words:
    stemmed_words.append(stemmer.stem(word))

  return stemmed_words
```

### Step 3: Loading and Preprocessing Text Data

The next step is to load and preprocess the text data. The code uses the `nltk.corpus.gutenberg` module to load the text data. The text data is then preprocessed by converting it to lowercase, tokenizing it, and stemming the words.

```python
def load_and_preprocess_text_data(filename):
  """Loads and preprocesses text data.

  Args:
    filename: The name of the text file.

  Returns:
    A list of preprocessed text data.
  """

  # Load the text data.
  text_data = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw(
